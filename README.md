# Round-Robin-Schedulling-Algorithm
<p> The implementation of Round Robin scheduling algorithm which is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned with a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. <br> The program generates a set of "processes" with random arrival times and CPU burst times using a random number generator, and then simulates the Round Robin algorithm for a set amount of time known as "Time Quantum". The program records the average waiting time and turnaround time for each process, and compares the results with the ideal scenario of a perfect scheduler. </p>
